# assemblyProject
I will be recording my journey of finalizing my assembly x86 3rd semester project.
This will be a near accurate imitation of the battleship game where multiple players take turns to guess and take out the opponent's ships.
Assembly involves a more hands-on approach with the hardware level programming so it will be interesting where this project takes us and the problems we are to tackle.
We will be using the irvine32 library and the associated operations.
